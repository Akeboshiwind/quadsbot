# Quads Bot

A silly bot for my friend group's chat group in telegram

## Running it

```bash
$ export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="<your token here>"
$ quadsbot
```

## Features

- Replies with "Checked" to valid "quads" and "sexts" messages
- If the bot has permissions to delete messages then all messages not sent on quads will be deleted

## Caveats

- Needs permissions to reply to messages
- Optionally needs permissions to delete messages
- Works using the TimeZone of the machine the bot is running on
